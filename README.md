# Linux for Cybersecurity

This repository contains my Linux learning journey, tailored for cybersecurity use. It includes:
- Basic & advanced Linux commands
- Bash scripting for enumeration and automation
- Security-focused troubleshooting and configurations

I'm using this as a living reference and skill log as I prepare for SOC & Pentesting roles.

P.s. I'm using Ubuntu in VirtualBox as I am still a beginner.
